Dynamic Website Development Coursework 1 - PHP and Backend Development

To install and use this website, please install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) and put the project inside the htdocs folder.
Then, navigate to the SQLDatabaseSetup folder and run either of the .sql files in phpMyAdmin to populate the backend database.

This project was my first time using full PHP alongside HTML and some *light* JavaScript. It probably breaks a few convention rules and has some bad practice somewhere.

Maybe I'll improve it in the future? Perhaps add a better login system that displays who you're logged in as in the Nav Bar?
